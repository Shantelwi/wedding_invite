# Wedding Invite website

This project is a wedding e-vite that lets the people who are invited rsvp or decline the invite and the user gets notified with an email using nodemailer.

Using react, html and css. I was able to make this web application.

Also viewers are able to go to the gift registries by clicking on the links and will be directed to the respected store they clicked on.

I had a hard time getting the emails to send but with the help or google and stack overflow I was able to get the emails and notifications working.

This was a tricky but fun application that can be used in real life situations and i am proud of myself with this project.
