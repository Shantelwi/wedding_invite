                Rebeca and Shantel's story began in the halls of Lakewood High, where the rhythms of the marching band set the backdrop for their budding friendship. Rebeca, a freshman on the drill team, and Shantel, a sophomore in the drumline. Their playful banter and flirtations ignited a spark, though Rebeca dismissed it as Shantel's natural charm, knowing she had a way with many girls. As they spent more time together, the lines of friendship blurred, and soon, their connection deepened into something undeniable. On June 5, 2014, at the quad of the school, Shantel took a leap of faith, asking Rebeca to be her girlfriend. With a heart full of joy, Rebeca said yes, marking the beginning of their journey as high school sweethearts.
                As the years rolled on, Rebeca and Shantel faced the complexities of growing up, navigating the challenges of relationships with unwavering devotion. Their love was tested but never broken; they communicated openly, worked through hardships, and celebrated each other's successes, becoming each other’s biggest supporters. By 2024, with friends and family playfully nudging her about the next step, Shantel finally felt ready to propose. One rainy afternoon, she knelt before Rebeca, heart racing, and asked, “Will you marry me?” Overwhelmed with joy, Rebeca said yes, sealing their love with a promise of forever. Together, they embraced the next chapter of their lives, ready to write the story of their love in vibrant new colors.
